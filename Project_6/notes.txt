When creating Dash apps, 
    you will almost always use the import statement above. 
        As you create more advanced Dash apps, you will import more packages.

This line is known as the Dash constructor 
    and is responsible for initializing your app. 
        It is almost always the same for any Dash app you create.

The app layout represents the app components that will be displayed in the web browser, normally contained within a html.Div. In this example, a single component was added: another html.Div. The Div has a few properties, such as children, which we use to add text content to the page: "Hello World".
